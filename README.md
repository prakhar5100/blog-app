This blog app is a basic example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses these technologies for both design and functionality. All CRUD operations are handled through JavaScript.
This web app is hosted online through firebase and can be accessed at https://blog-bed92.web.app/ or https://blog-bed92.firebaseapp.com/

The app includes features like searching, liking, disliking, commenting, and image uploads for blog posts. To create a post, you can simply input a title and content, optionally add an image, and click the "create" button. Your articles will be displayed under "Written Articles," where you can like, dislike, comment, edit, and delete them.

The blog app also has Firebase-based authentication, with separate sign-in and sign-up pages. A logout button is provided in the main app to return to the login page.

However, it's important to note some limitations:

    Posts don't persist after refreshing the page. You can only see the posts while the page is open.

    The app doesn't store user data like content and titles, so your content won't be saved after logging in.

    The like, dislike, and comment features are basic and need improvement.

    There are no provisions for password recovery, text decoration, or user customization.

Work is ongoing to address these issues and improve the app.
